Hi! I'm Philip Theus. I am looking for problems worth solving. With tons of experience tackling hard problems in software and a leading role in modularizing Shopify's monolith, I bring a wealth of knowledge in the architecture and collaborative creation of software. Right now my focus is on fighting climate change.

## Recent Events

- **2018-2021**: Led Componentization, a major rearchitecture of [Shopify](https://shopify.ca)'s monolith.
  - Wrote [Under Deconstruction](https://shopify.engineering/shopify-monolith) about my architecture work at Shopify, which reached #1 on Hacker News.
  - Developed the gradual modularization tool [Packwerk](https://github.com/shopify/packwerk), which has been the subject of [numerous talks and publications](packwerk-publications).
- **2021-2022**: Prototyped Domain Events and a general API Gateway at Shopify
- **2023**: [Developed LLM based product features](../posts/2024-01-31-llms-shiny-hammer) and co-designed [object model extensions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/opslevel_need-to-add-cost-data-to-your-services-maybe-activity-7158483661464502272-5m4d) for [OpsLevel](https://opslevel.com).
- **2024**: Supporting major software architecture transitions at [One Medical](https://onemedical.com) and [Ramp](https://ramp.com/), as well as providing architecture feedback to [Mangrove Systems](https://mangrovesystems.com).
- **Also 2024**: Married my wonderful partner and took her last name (Mueller üëâüèº Theus).
 
## Software Development Philosophy

- **Developer Happiness** is the most accurate proxy for productivity.
- **Short Feedback Cycles and Low Cognitive Load** are essential for effective development.
- **Iterative Approach**: Solve complex problems one step at a time.
- **Focus on Trajectories**: Continuous improvement trumps fixed goals.
- **Beyond Buzzwords**: Avoid the pitfalls of ideas turned into brands.
- **Emphasis on Readability and Malleability**: Make code navigable and systems easy to understand and modify.
