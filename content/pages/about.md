Hi! I'm Philip Mueller. I specialize in making large systems feel small. With tons of experience tackling hard problems in software and a leading role in modularizing Shopify's monolith, I bring a wealth of knowledge in the architecture and collaborative creation of software.

*I am currently available for consulting services.*
