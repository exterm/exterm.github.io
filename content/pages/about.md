Hi! I'm Philip Mueller. I help shape complex systems to be easy to maintain and extend. With tons of experience tackling hard problems in software and a leading role in modularizing Shopify's monolith, I bring a wealth of knowledge in the architecture and collaborative creation of software.

*I am currently available for consulting services.*

## Philosophy

- **Beyond Buzzwords**: Avoid the pitfalls of turning ideas into brands.
