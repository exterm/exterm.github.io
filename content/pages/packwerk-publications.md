title: "Publications Involving Packwerk"
---

[Packwerk](https://github.com/shopify/packwerk) is a tool for enforcing boundaries between components in a Ruby on Rails application, developed at Shopify. I had the original idea, prototyped it, and later led the development of the open source tool together with a kick-ass team.

Packwerk's adoption in the Ruby on Rails community is a testament to its effectiveness. It has been the subject of numerous talks and publications.
