title: "The Framework 13 Laptop, 1 year in"
---

When I first heard about [Framework](https://frame.work), a new laptop brand, I was instantly excited. A focus on repairability, and even upgradeability to later generations of hardware? In a nice, slim package? I've been waiting for this, especially since the Thinkpads have become less and less repairable.

So when I needed a new laptop in fall 2022, I bought a Framework 13 (12th generation intel, DIY model). In this post I share my impressions after over a year of intensive use.

My comparison points: I have been using Thinkpads (mostly T series) since 1998 as personal and work laptops, and Macbook Pros at work since 2016. This is the first laptop I've bought that is not a Thinkpad.

## Look & Feel

- Looks sleek and modern, but expansion ports are not a perfect fit
  - you'll see that even in official product photos
- Keyboard has a nice and chunky feel - might be the best laptop keyboard I've used since my first laptop, the Thinkpad 770
- Almost no flex
- Screen glossy (fixed in current models), otherwise seems very good

## Practicality

- brightness buttons not working with automatic brightness on linux
- everything else worked out of the box on fedora
- power consumption doesn't seem great on this one
- Performance as expected for a thin & light (compare dimensions & weight to macbook air)
- keyboard lighting adjustable (shortcut)
- power button light brightness adjustable in bios

## Framework Computer Inc

- My impression is they mean it, they really want to build a long term viable business and I think they may just be able to putll it off. That's an important consideration since when you buy a Framework, you make a bet on the company being successful, otherwise repair and upgrade will become a lot more difficult
- communication has mostly been great; e.g. the sleep and ports issue

  > We found unexpected CPU and retimer behavior in which placing a HDMI or DisplayPort Expansion Card on the same side of the laptop as any card other than USB-C could keep subsystems powered, whether or not a display was connected.

- not great: waiting for a BIOS update, security issues with the old one

I hope this post can help people who are on the fence about buying a Framework laptop make a decision.
